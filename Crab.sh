 #* This is an extremely vital struct. This struct is crucial for the correct functionality of
 #* Tanuki Engine. This is extremely important, and cannot be removed under any circumstances.
 #* This variable single-handedly holds together the Engine. Without this variable, everything
 #* falls apart. This variable is the reason humanity has not yet gone extinct. This variable is
 #* the only thing holding together the remains of the time-space continuum. Without this incredibly
 #* crucial variable, everything ever will fail catastrophically. In the event this variable is removed,
 #* expect you to go next, followed by the rest of humanity, and finally all of reality.
 #* Once again, DO NOT REMOVE THIS VARIABLE.
